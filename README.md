# Dependabot auto-merge example

> [!WARNING]  
> I highly recommend you **do not use this** as every PR that comes in from Dependabot should be reviewed by a human. Bad things will happen if you merge PRs automatically.

This is an example of how to setup auto-merge for Dependabot PRs to show how simple it is. All you need is [two workflows](.github/workflows).

If you do decide to use this in your project, make sure you have robust CI.
